__Meta-platform to end all plaftorms__

Nowadays, there are a lot of different streaming platforms that content creators can utilize to reach their audience including Twitch, Youtube, Reddit, Facebook Gaming among others. Your favorite streamer might stream on different medium or you might have different favorite streamers on different platforms. Instead of having to browse each platform separately to look for things to watch, wouldn't it be cool if you can browse all platforms all in one place?

Our app allows users to add their streamers on different platforms to their watchlist. It then provides a content feed showing which of their favorite streamers (and possibly similar streamers) are currently live on which platforms. When the user clicks on the content, we direct them to the original platform (e.g. Twitch).
