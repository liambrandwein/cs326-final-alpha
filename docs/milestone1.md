## Wireframes

### Sign In/Sign Up Pages

The Sign In and Sign Up pages will work how you expect them to. For the Sign Up page, users will need to provide an email that is not already registered, a password (that will meet certain requirements), and the same passowrd in the confirm field (otherwise they won't be able to click the "Create" button). The "Sign In" blue text will redirect the user to the Sign In page where they can provide their email and password to log in. The "Create Account" blue text will redirect the user to the Sign Up page.

### Watch History Page

The Watch History page allows the user to track their own history of watched streams or videos across different platforms. The user can search their history, clear history or filter history by platform.

### Search Results Page

The Search Results page displays the results for a given keyword (e.g. a content of interests "Chess" or a creator "GMNarodistky"), and allows user to navigate quickly to a live stream or a newly uploaded video. The page also allows the user to subscribe or unsubscribe to creators.

### Subscription Manager Page

Note that the final subscription manager HTML is a bit different from the original design wireframe as we find the latter design to be more elegant and user-friendly.
